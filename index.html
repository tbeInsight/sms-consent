<h1>SMS Consent – Insight Engineering – Operational Alerts</h1>

<div class="section">
    <p>
        This system sends automated SMS messages for operational and safety alerts
        generated by an industrial SCADA system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recipients are internal staff or contractors who have been explicitly added
        by an administrator to receive system alerts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Messages are transactional and not marketing-related. These may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Equipment fault notifications</li>
        <li>Alarm and safety alerts</li>
        <li>System status messages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Message frequency varies based on system conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recipients may opt out at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Verbal Opt-In Process</h2>

    <div class="conversation">
Manager: "Before we add you to the SCADA alerting system, I need to inform you that you will receive automated SMS messages related to operational and safety alerts generated by the SCADA system. Message frequency varies based on system conditions. These messages are not marketing or promotional. Message and data rates may apply depending on your mobile carrier. You may opt out at any time by replying STOP. Do you consent to receive these automated SMS messages?"

Recipient: "Yes, I consent."

Manager: "Thank you. Your consent has been recorded and you will receive a confirmation message shortly."
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Confirmation SMS Example</h2>
    <p>
        Immediately after verbal consent is obtained, a confirmation message is sent:
    </p>

    <div class="sms-example">
"You are now enrolled to receive automated SCADA operational and safety alerts from MainAqua. Message frequency varies. Reply STOP to opt out or HELP for assistance."
    </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Consent Recording and Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Verbal consent is documented at the time of onboarding. The following
        information is recorded and retained:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recipient phone number</li>
        <li>Date and time consent was obtained</li>
        <li>Name of the operator or manager obtaining consent</li>
        <li>Confirmation that the opt-in language was read verbatim and the recipient explicitly agreed to receive automated SMS messages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Consent records are stored securely in internal operational records and
        are retained for compliance and audit purposes. Records are retrievable
        upon request.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Opt-Out Process</h2>
    <p>
        All recipients are informed during verbal onboarding that they may opt out
        at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to any message.
    </p>
    <p>
        Opt-out instructions are also included in the confirmation message sent
        at onboarding. STOP requests are processed immediately and prevent any
        further messages from being sent.
